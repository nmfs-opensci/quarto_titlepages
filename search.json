    "text": "This work is based on this section of the Quarto manual https://quarto.org/docs/journals/templates.html#replacing-partials To see the LaTeX templates that Quarto is using start here: https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/main/src/resources/formats/pdf/pandoc/template.tex\nThis template makes a custom title page using the information in the YAML (from the xyz.qmd for an single doc and from index.qmd for a Quarto book). The default document classes in Quarto are scrbook and srcartcl, but these templates work for other document classes too. There are some other classes in the cls folder (krantz, svmono, elsevier). The static title pages are inspired from Latex Templates.\n\n\nThis is written assuming you are a LaTeX user and thus already know how to do what you want in LaTeX, but you need to figure out how to tell Quarto to do what you want. Skim the chapter on LaTeX document structure if you are unfamiliar with LaTeX so you know what I am talking about when I reference parts of a LaTeX document.\nQuarto has included a variety of YAML options you can use to alter your LaTeX document by passing in things like fontenc package options or geometry options in the YAML. I largely ignore all that and just pass in the header file I want. As a LaTeX user, I find all those YAML options confusing and I spend hours digging through the Quarto source code to figure out exactly how they are using the YAML options.\nThat said, for quarto_titlepages, I am mainly just swapping out the before-body.tex partial (the part that specs the title and front matter) and adding stuff to the header (before begin{document}).\n\n\n\nThere are 2 approaches that I considered.\n\nUse the title.tex partial (which defines things like title and author) and then redefine the \\maketitle command. Google and you’ll find examples. I find \\maketitle really irritating and is a constant headache to make custom title pages with it. But maybe you love it; in which case, try that approach.\nUse before-body.tex partial to get rid of the \\maketitle call and use my own \\begin{frontmatter}...\\end{frontmatter} section. I find this much more straightforward for creating custom titlepages. So that’s the approach I took.\n\n\n\n\nWhen recreating a government report title page, I don’t get to choose how the page looks. It has to look a very particular way. I find it easiest to just create that look manually rather than trying to figure out how to get the authblk LaTeX package to do what I want. authblk is a widely used LaTeX package which has helper functions for creating author lists along with affiliations.\nIf you use authblk in your titlepage, you will need to write your \\author and affil definitions in title.tex and then you can use those in before-body.tex in your \\begin{titlepage}...\\end{titlepage} code. See the LaTeX document structure page for tips.\n\n\n\nSee the notes chapter for some notes I took along the way."

    "text": "Some comments on my approach and why I did things the way I did.\n##\nIt is very common to use \\maketitle. When you customize a title page, you redefine this. I personnally find that approach more difficult than necessary. If I were writing a document class (cls), sure I’d use that but for of my work, I just find that more work than necessary.\nInstead I find it easier to include \\begin{titlepage}....\\end{titlepage} directly and not use \\maketitle at all. Background: within the documentclass (required for a LaTeX document), there will be a definitian of \\maketitle, a shortcut for a \\begin{title}....\\end{title} definition that specifies the look of the title page for that document class. Typically you’ll see this at the start of a LaTeX doc:\n\\begin{document}\n\\maketitle\nTo figure out what the \\maketitle code is, you have to dig into the document class. The document class is specified by a .cls file which you might not have access to. For example, the srcbook.cls document class used by Quarto is somewhere in the Quarto files. And in any case, document class files are hard to wade through. So instead one redefines \\maketitle in ones header (the part before \\begin{document}).\nBut for Quarto, the \\maketitle call is in the before-body.tex partial. So I can just pass in my own before-body.tex.\n\n\nThe authblk package (LaTeX) is very popular for defining the authors and affilliations for title pages. It has a lot of helper functions for defining \\author, which is a short-cut for a bunch of code to format an author list. If you look in the default title.tex partial, you see \\author being defined. That looks like the generic LaTeX \\author definition to me.\nIf we look at the title.tex template in the quarto journals bj template, it looks like they are using the authblk LaTeX package which has \\author[1] and \\affil like things.\nThe problem I have with using authblk, is that when recreating a government report title page, it’s not like I get to choose how the page looks. It has to look a very particular way. So I then need to learn how to alter the authblk defaults to get the author and affiliation looks that I need. Rather than fighting authblk to get what I want, I found it easier just to create the title page manually.\nOnce you have a handle on Pandoc template code, it is not hard to create things like\nauthor^1, author^1,2, author^3 and author^1\nusing a for loop in Pandoc. See the chapter on Pandoc templates."

Later, after \\begin{document}, we can use \\title to output a title. The formating is defined in the \\title definition in the document class cls file.\nauthors\nIf you are going to use \\author or the authblk package to help you generate your author list on your title page, this is where you do that. Here is a really common \\author specification for a LaTeX document.\nExample from Pandoc title.tex\n\\author{$for(author)$$author$$sep$ \\and $endfor$}\nThe is going to put, for example, the following LaTeX in the document:\n\\author{Jane Doe \\and Ashok Kumar \\and Matti Meikäläinen}\nIt gets the names from author: in the YAML.\n\\author is essentially a function in LaTeX and the bit in {...} is the arguments. The document class (the cls file) has the code to process define the \\author function using those arguments (the names). Later, after \\begin{document}, we can use \\author to call the author function and it will output a formatted list of the author names.\nauthblk package\nWe also typically have author affiliations that we want to print. The authblk package helps with that.\nIt modifies the \\author function to have a number for the affiliation. So \\author[1]{author name 1} and has a \\affil[#]{affiliation} function to define the affiliation 1. So you would see something like this\n\\author[1]{Junli Liu}\n\\author[2]{James Rowe}\n\\author[3]{Keith Lindsey}\n\\affil[1]{address one}\n\\affil[2]{address two}\n\\affil[3]{address three}\n\n\n\nThis is where the command to make a title page is issued. Typically, you will see \\maketitle called. \\maketitle is a function defined in the document class cls file and specifies how the title page looks.\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\maketitle\n\nALL YOUR CONTENT\n\n\\end{document}\nBut we don’t have to use \\maketitle at all. We can define our own title page. This is the approach quarto_titlepages uses.\n\\begin{titlepage}\n\n<<< Code for your title page >>>\n\n\\end{titlepage}\nFor example, (the MWE from the base LaTeX installation):\n\\begin{titlepage}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.15\\textwidth]{example-image-1x1}\\par\\vspace{1cm}\n    {\\scshape\\Jacksonville State University \\par}\n    \\vspace{1cm}\n    {\\scshape\\Large Final year project\\par}\n    \\vspace{1.5cm}\n    {\\huge\\bfseries Pigeons love doves\\par}\n    \\vspace{2cm}\n    {\\Large\\itshape John Birdwatch\\par}\n    \\vfill\n    supervised by\\par\n    Dr.~Mark \\textsc{Brown}\n\n    \\vfill\n\n% Bottom of the page\n    {\\large \\today\\par}\n\\end{titlepage}\n\n\n\nIn a book document class, the title page is created using \\frontmatter (again that’s a function). If that is the case, you need to define the frontmatter otherwise the frontmatter (with title page) from the class definition will be used. So you have to use\n\\begin{frontmatter}\n\\begin{titlepage}\n<<< Code for our title page >>>\n\\end{titlepage}\n\\end{frontmatter}\n\n\n\n\nThe most common problem I have is that LaTeX wants a empty line feed (carriage return) at the end of my _titlepage.tex code. I often forget and then it complains that \\begin{titlepage} did not end."
