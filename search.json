    "text": "The extension provides a format titlepage-pdf where you can specify a variety of themes. Here are the themes available.\n\n\n\n\nquarto use template nmfs-opensci/quarto_titlepages\nThis will install the extension in the _extension folder plus all the demo files. Essentially, you will be cloning the repo into a new folder and you will be asked at installation for the name of the (empty) folder/directory that you want to install into.\n\n\n\nYou may also use this format with an existing Quarto project or document. This will install only the files in the _extension folder and will not install the files above that (the demo files).\nFrom the quarto project or document directory, run the following command:\nquarto install extension nmfs-opensci/quarto_titlepages\n\n\n\n\nIn your document yaml add the format and a titlepage theme.\nformat: \n  titlepage-pdf:\n    titlepage: great-wave\nThen render the document. How? That depends on the IDE you are using. There should be a render ‘button’ or drop-down or you can run this command from the shell.\nquarto render article.qmd\nassuming your qmd file is named article.qmd.\n\n\n\nSome themes need some additional YAML information to work.\n\n\nNeeds info on the titlepage geometry so the title doesn’t overlap the background image. Also you need to supply the background image and where to put it (UL, upperleft; UR, upperright; BL, bottomleft; BR, bottomright). Note, there are placeholders in the extension, but when you put your own image in, you will need to add the YAML information.\ntitlepage: bg-image\ntitlepage-geometry: \n  - top=3in\n  - bottom=1in\n  - right=1in\n  - left=1in\ntitle-bg-image: \"img/corner-bg.png\"\ntitle-bg-location: \"UL\"\ntitle-bg-size: 0.5\n\n\n\nGreat wave theme creates a cover page with a background image that fills the width of the page at the bottom with a color above. You need to specify the image and the upper color (unless you want to use the default Great Wave off Kanagawa image).\ndocumentclass: scrbook\nnumber-sections: true\ntitle-bg-image: \"img/TheGreatWaveoffKanagawa.jpeg\"\ntitle-page-color: \"F6D5A8\"\n\n\n\n\nThe document class changes the look of your document. For the book document classes, you will need to pass in\nnumber-sections: true\nin your YAML because Quarto sets number-sections: false by default and that will mess up all your equation, figure and table numbers. It simple will not number them correctly at all.\n\n\nThe KOMA scrbook document class has many options that your can use to change the look of your book. Read the documentation here.\nIf you want chapters to be allowed to start on even or odd pages and the left and right margins on even and odd pages to be the same, use\nclassoption: [\"oneside\", \"open=any\"]\n\n\n\nThis document class is more for single documents with sections and the equation, figure and table numbering will be 1, 2, 3, … as opposed to 1.1, 1.2, etc, with the chapter number included in the number. The default in Quarto is no section or chapter numbers. Use\nnumber-sections: true\nif you want numbers.\n\n\n\nThe cls folder has some other document classes that you can use. Specify by providing the path to the document class file. For example,\ndocumentclass: cls/krantz.cls\nThe base TeX document classes are article, report, and book. But there are many many more available to customize the look of your document. Here is a Stackoverflow post with a few discusssed here.\n\n\n\n\nYou can add a table of contents (toc: true), list of figures (lof: true) and list of tables (lot: true). The depth of the TOC is specified with toc-depth. Example:\nformat:\n  titlepage-pdf:\n    titlepage: bg-image\n    documentclass: scrartcl\n    toc: true\n    toc-depth: 3\n    lof: true\n    lot: true"

    "text": "Some comments on my approach and why I did things the way I did.\n##\nIt is very common to use \\maketitle. When you customize a title page, you redefine this. I personnally find that approach more difficult than necessary. If I were writing a document class (cls), sure I’d use that but for of my work, I just find that more work than necessary.\nInstead I find it easier to include \\begin{titlepage}....\\end{titlepage} directly and not use \\maketitle at all. Background: within the documentclass (required for a LaTeX document), there will be a definitian of \\maketitle, a shortcut for a \\begin{title}....\\end{title} definition that specifies the look of the title page for that document class. Typically you’ll see this at the start of a LaTeX doc:\n\\begin{document}\n\\maketitle\nTo figure out what the \\maketitle code is, you have to dig into the document class. The document class is specified by a .cls file which you might not have access to. For example, the srcbook.cls document class used by Quarto is somewhere in the Quarto files. And in any case, document class files are hard to wade through. So instead one redefines \\maketitle in ones header (the part before \\begin{document}).\nBut for Quarto, the \\maketitle call is in the before-body.tex partial. So I can just pass in my own before-body.tex.\n\n\nThe authblk package (LaTeX) is very popular for defining the authors and affilliations for title pages. It has a lot of helper functions for defining \\author, which is a short-cut for a bunch of code to format an author list. If you look in the default title.tex partial, you see \\author being defined. That looks like the generic LaTeX \\author definition to me.\nIf we look at the title.tex template in the quarto journals bj template, it looks like they are using the authblk LaTeX package which has \\author[1] and \\affil like things.\nThe problem I have with using authblk, is that when recreating a government report title page, it’s not like I get to choose how the page looks. It has to look a very particular way. So I then need to learn how to alter the authblk defaults to get the author and affiliation looks that I need. Rather than fighting authblk to get what I want, I found it easier just to create the title page manually.\nOnce you have a handle on Pandoc template code, it is not hard to create things like\nauthor^1, author^1,2, author^3 and author^1\nusing a for loop in Pandoc. See the chapter on Pandoc templates."

    "text": "For the purposes of quarto_titlepages, this is all you need to know.\n\\documentclass[<<<classoption>>>]{<<<document class>>>}\n\n<<<include-in-header static>>>\n\n<<<title.tex template>>>\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n<<<before-body.tex template>>>\n\nALL YOUR CONTENT\n\n\\end{document}\n\n\nThis specifies the look of your PDF. It is specified by a .cls file. Quarto uses by default scrartcl and scrbook. If you want to customize a document class, you can start with class options. You’ll need to dig into the CTAN documentation to see what is available: scrbook and srcartcl.\n    documentclass: scrbook\n    classoption: [\"onepage\", \"openany\"]\n\n\n\nThis is static LaTeX. Static means it doesn’t using any variable from your YAML. It is just plain LaTeX. Headers on LaTeX documents are used to specify extra packages to use and define or redefine commands. It can get pretty complex. But quarto_title pages, we really don’t need much. I used the babel package for some diacritic (accents on letters) and the hyphenat package to stop titles from being hyphenated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nquarto_titlepages does not use title.tex I include this section because defining authors using \\author{} is ubiquitous in LaTeX, so you should know a) what it is and b) what to do if you want to use it. Why doesn’t quarto_titlepages use it? Because the standard LaTeX title pages are nothing like the title pages I need for government reports. I would in a constant fight against the pre-defined \\author function or the authblk package functions if I used it.\n\n\nPandoc allows you to use a Pandoc template (meaning you can uses variables in your YAML). To that you can use title.tex. Despite the name, it is not restricted to using for the title. It is just that that is how Pandoc uses it.\ntitle\nYou might see title defined here like so.\n\\title{Here is the title.}\n\\title is a function and {..} is the argument for it. Later, after \\begin{document}, we can use \\title to output a title. The formating is defined in the \\title definition in the document class cls file.\nauthors\nIf you are going to use \\author or the authblk package to help you generate your author list on your title page, this is where you do that. Here is a really common \\author specification for a LaTeX document.\nExample from Pandoc title.tex\n\\author{$for(author)$$author$$sep$ \\and $endfor$}\nThe is going to put, for example, the following LaTeX in the document:\n\\author{Jane Doe \\and Ashok Kumar \\and Matti Meikäläinen}\nIt gets the names from author: in the YAML.\n\\author is essentially a function in LaTeX and the bit in {...} is the arguments. The document class (the cls file) has the code to process define the \\author function using those arguments (the names). Later, after \\begin{document}, we can use \\author to call the author function and it will output a formatted list of the author names.\nauthblk package\nWe also typically have author affiliations that we want to print. The authblk package helps with that.\nIt modifies the \\author function to have a number for the affiliation. So \\author[1]{author name 1} and has a \\affil[#]{affiliation} function to define the affiliation 1. So you would see something like this\n\\author[1]{Junli Liu}\n\\author[2]{James Rowe}\n\\author[3]{Keith Lindsey}\n\\affil[1]{address one}\n\\affil[2]{address two}\n\\affil[3]{address three}\n\n\n\nThis is where the command to make a title page is issued. Typically, you will see \\maketitle called. \\maketitle is a function defined in the document class cls file and specifies how the title page looks.\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\maketitle\n\nALL YOUR CONTENT\n\n\\end{document}\nBut we don’t have to use \\maketitle at all. We can define our own title page. This is the approach quarto_titlepages uses.\n\\begin{titlepage}\n\n<<< Code for your title page >>>\n\n\\end{titlepage}\nFor example, (the MWE from the base LaTeX installation):\n\\begin{titlepage}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.15\\textwidth]{example-image-1x1}\\par\\vspace{1cm}\n    {\\scshape\\Jacksonville State University \\par}\n    \\vspace{1cm}\n    {\\scshape\\Large Final year project\\par}\n    \\vspace{1.5cm}\n    {\\huge\\bfseries Pigeons love doves\\par}\n    \\vspace{2cm}\n    {\\Large\\itshape John Birdwatch\\par}\n    \\vfill\n    supervised by\\par\n    Dr.~Mark \\textsc{Brown}\n\n    \\vfill\n\n% Bottom of the page\n    {\\large \\today\\par}\n\\end{titlepage}\n\n\n\nIn a book document class, the title page is created using \\frontmatter (again that’s a function). If that is the case, you need to define the frontmatter otherwise the frontmatter (with title page) from the class definition will be used. So you have to use\n\\begin{frontmatter}\n\\begin{titlepage}\n<<< Code for our title page >>>\n\\end{titlepage}\n\\end{frontmatter}\n\n\n\n\nThe most common problem I have is that LaTeX wants a empty line feed (carriage return) at the end of my _titlepage.tex code. I often forget and then it complains that \\begin{titlepage} did not end."

    "text": "For LaTeX users\nPandoc has a template that it uses to create the LaTeX document. Certain key parts of the template are specified with files (template partials) with the code for that section. For our purposes, the key template partials are title.tex and before-body.tex.\n\\documentclass[<<<classoption>>>]{<<<document class>>>}\n\n<<<include-in-header static>>>\n\n<<<title.tex template>>>\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n<<<before-body.tex template>>>\n\nALL YOUR CONTENT\n\n\\end{document}\nThe title.tex template is defining things like \\author and before-body.tex is calling \\maketitle. When you pass in before-body.tex in template-partials: in your document YAML, it replaces the default one.\nThus by passing in title.tex or before-body.tex, you replace the title page specification by you own specification.\n\n\ntemplate versus static A template mixes Pandoc templating code with LaTeX and allows you to use variables from the YAML in our file. Static must have plain LaTeX. Note a template file can be plain LaTeX too, if you want.\nspecial template files There are some template files that are special because Pandoc uses files of the same name to input code in the same places. For our purposes, we need to know about before-body.tex and title.tex.\n\n\n\n\nPass in title.tex with the \\author and \\affil specified how you want. You will probably want to redefine \\maketitle. Search google for how to do that. It is a standard way to customize the title page. That’s all you need to do. The title page will be created with \\maketitle which is in the default before-body.tex.\nDitch \\maketitle and create your own title page using \\begin{titlepage}....\\end{titlepage}. In this case, you will pass in before-body.tex. You don’t need to specify title.tex; that LaTeX code is only used for \\maketitle and you won’t have that in your new before-body.tex. This is the approach used by quarto-titlepages.\n\n\n\n\nYou can open up the repo on RStudio Cloud. Log in with an account or with Google if you don’t want to create an account.\nStart with a static title page by going to titlepages/vline-static.\n\nOpen up article.qmd and click Render. Or open a shell and type\n\nquarto render titlepages/vline-static/article.qmd\n\nOpen before-body.tex to see what it is doing.\nOpen _titlepage.tex to see the code that defines the title page.\n\n\n\n\nGo to the chapter on How to modify."

    "text": "This work is based on this section of the Quarto manual https://quarto.org/docs/journals/templates.html#replacing-partials To see the LaTeX templates that Quarto is using start here: https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/main/src/resources/formats/pdf/pandoc/template.tex\nThis template makes a custom title page using the information in the YAML (from the xyz.qmd for an single doc and from index.qmd for a Quarto book). The default document classes in Quarto are scrbook and srcartcl, but these templates work for other document classes too. There are some other classes in the cls folder (krantz, svmono, elsevier). The static title pages are inspired from Latex Templates.\n\n\nThis is documentation is written assuming you are a LaTeX user and thus already know how to do what you want in LaTeX, but you need to figure out how to tell Quarto to do what you want.\nNon-LaTeX users, who just want to use the themes that I created, can use the titlepage-pdf format that is included in the extension. See the chapter on the Using the extension. If you are a non-LaTeX user who wants to create a custom title page or cover, skim the chapter on LaTeX document structure so you know what I am talking about when I reference parts of a LaTeX document.\nQuarto has included a variety of YAML options you can use to alter your LaTeX document by passing in things like fontenc package options or geometry options in the YAML. I largely ignore all that and just pass in the header file I want. As a LaTeX user, I find all those YAML options confusing and I spend hours digging through the Quarto source code to figure out exactly how they are using the YAML options.\nThat said, for quarto_titlepages, I am mainly just swapping out the before-body.tex partial (the part that specs the title and front matter) and adding stuff to the header (before begin{document}).\n\n\n\nThere are 2 approaches that I considered.\n\nUse the title.tex partial (which defines things like title and author) and then redefine the \\maketitle command. Google and you’ll find examples. I find \\maketitle really irritating and is a constant headache to make custom title pages with it. But maybe you love it; in which case, try that approach.\nUse before-body.tex partial to get rid of the \\maketitle call and use my own \\begin{frontmatter}...\\end{frontmatter} section. I find this much more straightforward for creating custom titlepages. So that’s the approach I took.\n\n\n\n\nWhen recreating a government report title page, I don’t get to choose how the page looks. It has to look a very particular way. I find it easiest to just create that look manually rather than trying to figure out how to get the authblk LaTeX package to do what I want. authblk is a widely used LaTeX package which has helper functions for creating author lists along with affiliations.\nIf you use authblk in your titlepage, you will need to write your \\author and affil definitions in title.tex and then you can use those in before-body.tex in your \\begin{titlepage}...\\end{titlepage} code. See the LaTeX document structure page for tips.\n\n\n\nSee the notes chapter for some notes I took along the way."
